# Stock Market Price Prediction

Stock Market Price Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict future stock prices based on historical data. It utilizes various machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze historical stock market data and make predictions about future price movements.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gather historical stock market data from reliable sources or APIs.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleanse and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features or indicators that may impact stock prices.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilize machine learning algorithms, such as regression or time series models, to predict stock prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the prediction models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.
- **Visualization**: Visualize historical and predicted stock prices to gain insights and facilitate decision-making.
